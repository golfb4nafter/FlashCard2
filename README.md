# FlashCard2
CompTia Security+ (Personal) Acronym flash card program.  

I put at least ten minutes into creating this simple flash card app.

Whenever I find another Acronym or port number I want to remember I add it to the XML data file.
When I have a few minutes I click on next then speak out what the acronym stands for.  
If I don't know I mouse over the big text box for the simple definition or reminder I left myself.
I was able to pass the Security+ exam on my first try so I am pretty sure this app helped me.

File/Ssve sorts the xml entries and saves the sorted file.  
Be sure to move the newly sorted XML file back to the data folder.

Feel free to contribute.
